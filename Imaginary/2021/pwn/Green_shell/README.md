The Green Shell is a launchable, which when launched from a player, will start moving. The shell takes 5 bounces on walls before it will break. This can be deadly to players ahead as they must dodge it. It is referred to players as the "worst" shell, mainly because it roams freely instead of targeting a player. The shell is green with black lines. Connect with nc oreos.imaginary.ml 12345.
