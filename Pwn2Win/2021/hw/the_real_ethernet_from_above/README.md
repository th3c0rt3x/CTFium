Shortly after Laura managed to reverse engineer the first version of the access control system, the government lab released a second version! The requirements document now contains the following specification: "the bitfile should work correctly only when programmed to official government boards".

Laura recalled the report of a similar mechanism described in the time capsule files. In 2018, Brazil, the country to which the island belonged, implemented a similar mechanism in the DREs they used to elect their politicians.

Knowing the Rhiza test infrastructure programs the bitfile provided by the user to an official government board, find out which access code is accepted by this new version of the bitfile.

Note: You still need to reverse engineer the bitfile. But now, besides that, you also need to interact with the test infrastructure.

Important: The switch port to which the board is connected is filtered. Only packets coming from the 200.18.104.100 address are able to reach the internet.
