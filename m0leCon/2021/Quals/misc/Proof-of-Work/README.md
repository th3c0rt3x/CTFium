 In this challenge you simply need to solve a proof-of-work. The proof-of-work will be the same for most of the challenges, so we provide you with a template in Python to solve it. Simply run it to get this flag.

This solver is not the fastest possible, so you can write your own, but you won't receive any support on it.
